## Overview

The Black Duck plugin for TFS and Azure DevOps allows you to automatically find and fix open source security vulnerabilities during your application build process, so you can proactively manage risk. The integration allows you to receive alerts and fail builds when any Black Duck policy violations are met.

## Documentation

Instructions and examples for the TFS/Azure DevOps Extension are available on our [Public Confluence](https://synopsys.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/INTDOCS/pages/622655/Running+Hub+Detect+with+TFS+or+Azure+DevOps)
