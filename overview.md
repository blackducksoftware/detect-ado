## Overview ##

The [Synopsys Detect](https://synopsys.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/INTDOCS/pages/62423113/Synopsys+Detect) plugin for Azure DevOps (formerly known as Hub Detect) supports Software Composition Analysis (SCA: open source software detection). It is architected to seamlessly integrate Synopsys Detect with Azure DevOps build and release pipelines. Synopsys Detect makes it easier to set up and scan code bases using a variety of languages and package managers across different application security techniques.  

As a Synopsys and Azure DevOps user, Synopsys Detect Extension for Azure DevOps enables you to:

•	Run a component scan in an Azure DevOps job:

•	Create projects and releases in Black Duck through the Azure DevOps job.
	
•	After a scan is complete, the results are available on the Black Duck server (for SCA)
